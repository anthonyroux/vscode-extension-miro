# How to run it
Open the project into VS Code
```bash
git clone https://github.com/anthonyroux/vscode-extension-miro.git
code vscode-extension-miro
```

Press `F5`. This will compile and run the extension in a new Extension Development Host window.

Run the `Miro` extension command from the Command Palette (⇧⌘P) in the new window.

Enter a valid Miro board URL.

Profit!

You can find the code in `src/extension.ts`
